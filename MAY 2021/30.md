#### [692. Top K Frequent Words](https://leetcode.com/problems/top-k-frequent-words/)

Given a non-empty list of words, return the k most frequent elements.

Your answer should be sorted by frequency from highest to lowest. If two words have the same frequency, then the word with the lower alphabetical order comes first.



```
Example 1:
Input: ["i", "love", "leetcode", "i", "love", "coding"], k = 2
Output: ["i", "love"]
Explanation: "i" and "love" are the two most frequent words.
    Note that "i" comes before "love" due to a lower alphabetical order.
    
Example 2:
Input: ["the", "day", "is", "sunny", "the", "the", "the", "sunny", "is", "is"], k = 4
Output: ["the", "is", "sunny", "day"]
Explanation: "the", "is", "sunny" and "day" are the four most frequent words,
    with the number of occurrence being 4, 3, 2 and 1 respectively.

```

Note:
* You may assume k is always valid, 1 ≤ k ≤ number of unique elements.
* Input words contain only lowercase letters.

#### [747. Largest Number At Least Twice of Others](https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-number-at-least-twice-of-others/)

You are given an integer array nums where the largest integer is unique.

Determine whether the largest element in the array is at least twice as much as every other number in the array. If it is, return the index of the largest element, or return -1 otherwise.



```
Example 1:
Input: nums = [3,6,1,0]
Output: 1
Explanation: 6 is the largest integer.
For every other number in the array x, 6 is at least twice as big as x.
The index of value 6 is 1, so we return 1.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: -1
Explanation: 4 is less than twice the value of 3, so we return -1.

Example 3:
Input: nums = [1]
Output: 0
Explanation: 1 is trivially at least twice the value as any other number because there are no other numbers.

```

Constraints:

* 1 <= nums.length <= 50
* 0 <= nums[i] <= 100
* The largest element in nums is unique.

### JavaScript

```js

/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number}
 */
var dominantIndex = function(nums) {
    let maxNumber = Math.max(...nums)
    for(let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++){
        if(nums[i] !== maxNumber && nums[i] * 2 > maxNumber){
                return -1
        } 
    }
    return nums.indexOf(maxNumber)
};

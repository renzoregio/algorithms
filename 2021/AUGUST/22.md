#### [1160. Find Words That Can Be Formed by Characters](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-words-that-can-be-formed-by-characters/)

You are given an array of strings words and a string chars.

A string is good if it can be formed by characters from chars (each character can only be used once).

Return the sum of lengths of all good strings in words.



```
Example 1:
Input: words = ["cat","bt","hat","tree"], chars = "atach"
Output: 6
Explanation: The strings that can be formed are "cat" and "hat" so the answer is 3 + 3 = 6.

Example 2:
Input: words = ["hello","world","leetcode"], chars = "welldonehoneyr"
Output: 10
Explanation: The strings that can be formed are "hello" and "world" so the answer is 5 + 5 = 10.
```

Constraints:

* 1 <= words.length <= 1000
* 1 <= words[ i ].length, chars.length <= 100
* words[ i ] and chars consist of lowercase English letters.

### JavaScript

```js
/**
 * @param {string[]} words
 * @param {string} chars
 * @return {number}
 */
var countCharacters = function(words, chars) {
    const letters = chars.split("")
    let total = 0
    words.forEach(word => {
        let count = 0;
        let lettersCopy = [...letters]
        for(let i = 0; i < word.length; i++){
            if(lettersCopy.includes(word[i])){
                lettersCopy.splice(lettersCopy.indexOf(word[i]), 1)
                count++
            } else {
                break
            }
            total += checkIfMatch(count, word.length)
        }
    })
    return total
};


const checkIfMatch = (count, length) => {
    if(count === length){
        return count
    }
    return 0
}
```

### Python3

```py3
class Solution:
    def countCharacters(self, words: List[str], chars: str) -> int:
        chars = list(chars)
        total = 0
        for word in words:
            chars_copy = chars.copy()
            removed = 0
            if len(word) <= len(chars):
                for letter in word:
                    if letter in chars_copy:
                        chars_copy.remove(letter)
                        removed += 1
                    else:
                        break
                    if removed == len(word):
                        total += removed
        return total
```

#### [75. Sort Colors](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-colors/)

Given an array nums with n objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue.

We will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue, respectively.

You must solve this problem without using the library's sort function.


```

Example 1:
Input: nums = [2,0,2,1,1,0]
Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]

Example 2:
Input: nums = [2,0,1]
Output: [0,1,2]

Example 3:
Input: nums = [0]
Output: [0]

Example 4:
Input: nums = [1]
Output: [1]

```

Constraints:

* n == nums.length
* 1 <= n <= 300
* nums[ i ] is 0, 1, or 2.

            twos.append(2)
            nums.remove(2)
        if ones:
            for num in ones:
                nums.append(num)
        if twos:
            for num in twos:
                nums.append(num)
        
```

#### [374. Guess Number Higher or Lower](https://leetcode.com/problems/guess-number-higher-or-lower/)

We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:

I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.

Every time you guess wrong, I will tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower than your guess.

You call a pre-defined API int guess(int num), which returns three possible results:

* -1: Your guess is higher than the number I picked (i.e. num > pick).
* 1: Your guess is lower than the number I picked (i.e. num < pick).
* 0: your guess is equal to the number I picked (i.e. num == pick).

Return the number that I picked.

Example 1:

```
Input: n = 10, pick = 6
Output: 6
```

Example 2:

```
Input: n = 1, pick = 1
Output: 1
```

Example 3:

```
Input: n = 2, pick = 1
Output: 1
```

Constraints:

* 1 <= n <= 2<sup>31</sup> - 1
* 1 <= pick <= n

/**

 * @param {number} num   your guess
 * @return 	     -1 if num is higher than the picked number
 *			      1 if num is lower than the picked number
 *               otherwise return 0
 * var guess = function(num) {}

/**

var guessNumber = function(n) {
    let l = 1;
     
    while(true){
        const m = Math.round((l + n) / 2)
        const res = guess(m)
        
        if(res === -1){
            n = m - 1
        } else if (res === 1){
            l = m + 1
        } else
            return m
    }
};

```

```js

/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @return {number}
 */
var countSegments = function(s) {
    let count = 0;
    let word = "";
    
    for(let i = 0; i < s.length; i++){
        if(s[i] === " "){
            if(word.length)
                count++
            word = ""
        } else
            word += s[i]
    }
    
    return word.length ? count + 1 : count
};

#### [1827. Minimum Operations to Make the Array Increasing](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-operations-to-make-the-array-increasing/)

You are given an integer array nums (0-indexed). In one operation, you can choose an element of the array and increment it by 1.

* For example, if nums = [1,2,3], you can choose to increment nums[1] to make nums = [1,3,3].

Return the minimum number of operations needed to make nums strictly increasing.

An array nums is strictly increasing if nums[ i ] < nums[ i + 1 ] for all 0 <= i < nums.length - 1. An array of length 1 is trivially strictly increasing.

```
Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,1,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: You can do the following operations:
1) Increment nums[2], so nums becomes [1,1,2].
2) Increment nums[1], so nums becomes [1,2,2].
3) Increment nums[2], so nums becomes [1,2,3].

Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,5,2,4,1]
Output: 14

Example 3:
Input: nums = [8]
Output: 0
```

Constraints:

* 1 <= nums.length <= 5000
* 1 <= nums[ i ] <= 10<sup>4</sup>

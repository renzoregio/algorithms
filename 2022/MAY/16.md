#### [2180. Count Integers With Even Digit Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-integers-with-even-digit-sum/)

Given a positive integer num, return the number of positive integers less than or equal to num whose digit sums are even.

The digit sum of a positive integer is the sum of all its digits.

Example 1:

```
Input: num = 4
Output: 2
Explanation:
The only integers less than or equal to 4 whose digit sums are even are 2 and 4.    
```

Example 2:

```
Input: num = 30
Output: 14
Explanation:
The 14 integers less than or equal to 30 whose digit sums are even are
2, 4, 6, 8, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 20, 22, 24, 26, and 28.
```

Constraints:

* 1 <= num <= 1000

### JavaScript

```js

/**
 * @param {number} num
 * @return {number}
 */
var countEven = function(num) {
    let count = 0;
    
    for(let i = 1; i <= num; i++){
        let n = i.toString()
        
        if(n.length === 1 && +n % 2 === 0)
            count++
        else {
            let temp = 0
            
            for(let j = 0; j < n.length; j++)
                temp += +n[j]
            
            if(temp % 2 === 0)
                count++
        }
            
    }
    
    return count
};

```

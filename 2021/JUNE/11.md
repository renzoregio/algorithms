#### [154. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array II](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-minimum-in-rotated-sorted-array-ii/)

Suppose an array of length n sorted in ascending order is rotated between 1 and n times. For example, the array nums = [0,1,4,4,5,6,7] might become:

* [4,5,6,7,0,1,4] if it was rotated 4 times.
* [0,1,4,4,5,6,7] if it was rotated 7 times.

Notice that rotating an array [a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]] 1 time results in the array [a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]].

Given the sorted rotated array nums that may contain duplicates, return the minimum element of this array.

You must decrease the overall operation steps as much as possible.

```
Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,3,5]
Output: 1

Example 2:
Input: nums = [2,2,2,0,1]
Output: 0
```

Constraints:

* n == nums.length
* 1 <= n <= 5000
* -5000 <= nums[i] <= 5000
* nums is sorted and rotated between 1 and n times.

### JavaScript

```js

/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number}
 */
var findMin = function(nums) {
    let numbers = [...new Set(nums)]
    return Math.min(...numbers)
};

```

-----

### Python3

```py

class Solution:
    def findMin(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        numbers = list(set(nums))
        return min(numbers)

### QUESTION

#### [28. Implement strStr()](https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-strstr/)

Implement strStr().

Return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or -1 if needle is not part of haystack.

Clarification:

What should we return when needle is an empty string? This is a great question to ask during an interview.

For the purpose of this problem, we will return 0 when needle is an empty string. This is consistent to C's strstr() and Java's indexOf().

```
Example 1:
Input: haystack = "hello", needle = "ll"
Output: 2

Example 2:
Input: haystack = "aaaaa", needle = "bba"
Output: -1

Example 3:
Input: haystack = "", needle = ""
Output: 0
```

Constraints:

* 0 <= haystack.length, needle.length <= 5 * 10<sup>4</sup>
* haystack and needle consist of only lower-case English characters.

### JavaScript

```js

/**
 * @param {string} haystack
 * @param {string} needle
 * @return {number}
 */
var strStr = function(haystack, needle) {
    if(needle === ""){
        return 0;
    } else {
        let start = 0;
        let end = needle.length
        while(start < haystack.length){
            if(needle === haystack.slice(start,end)){
                return start
            }
            start += 1
            end += 1
        }
        return -1 
    }
};

```

### Python

```py

class Solution(object):
    def strStr(self, haystack, needle):
        """
        :type haystack: str
        :type needle: str
        :rtype: int
        """
        if needle == "":
            return 0
        elif needle not in haystack:
            return -1
        else:
            start = 0
            end = len(needle)
            while start < len(haystack):
                if needle == haystack[start:end]:
                    return start
                start += 1
                end += 1
        
```

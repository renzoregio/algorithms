#### [318. Maximum Product of Word Lengths](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-product-of-word-lengths/)

Given a string array words, return the maximum value of length(word[i]) * length(word[j]) where the two words do not share common letters. If no such two words exist, return 0.

Example 1:

```
Input: words = ["abcw","baz","foo","bar","xtfn","abcdef"]
Output: 16
Explanation: The two words can be "abcw", "xtfn".
```

Example 2:

```
Input: words = ["a","ab","abc","d","cd","bcd","abcd"]
Output: 4
Explanation: The two words can be "ab", "cd".
```

Example 3:

```
Input: words = ["a","aa","aaa","aaaa"]
Output: 0
Explanation: No such pair of words.
```


Constraints:

* 2 <= words.length <= 1000
* 1 <= words[i].length <= 1000
* words[i] consists only of lowercase English letters.

### JavaScript

```js

/**
 * @param {string[]} words
 * @return {number}
 */
var maxProduct = function(words) {
    let maxLength = 0;
    for(let i = 0; i < words.length; i++){
        for(let j = i + 1; j < words.length; j++){
            let count = 0;
            let passed = true;
            while(count < words[i].length){
                if(words[j].includes(words[i][count])){
                    passed = false;
                    break;
                }
                count++;
            }
            
            if(passed){
                let val = words[i].length * words[j].length;
                if(val > maxLength){
                    maxLength = val;
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
    return maxLength;
};

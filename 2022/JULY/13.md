#### [599. Minimum Index Sum of Two Lists](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-index-sum-of-two-lists/)

Suppose Andy and Doris want to choose a restaurant for dinner, and they both have a list of favorite restaurants represented by strings.

You need to help them find out their common interest with the least list index sum. If there is a choice tie between answers, output all of them with no order requirement. You could assume there always exists an answer.

Example 1:

```
Input: list1 = ["Shogun","Tapioca Express","Burger King","KFC"], list2 = ["Piatti","The Grill at Torrey Pines","Hungry Hunter Steakhouse","Shogun"]
Output: ["Shogun"]
Explanation: The only restaurant they both like is "Shogun".
```

Example 2:

```
Input: list1 = ["Shogun","Tapioca Express","Burger King","KFC"], list2 = ["KFC","Shogun","Burger King"]
Output: ["Shogun"]
Explanation: The restaurant they both like and have the least index sum is "Shogun" with index sum 1 (0+1).
```

Constraints:

* 1 <= list1.length, list2.length <= 1000
* 1 <= list1[ i ].length, list2[ i ].length <= 30
* list1[ i ] and list2[ i ] consist of spaces ' ' and English letters.
* All the stings of list1 are unique.
* All the stings of list2 are unique.

### JavaScript

```js

/**
 * @param {string[]} list1
 * @param {string[]} list2
 * @return {string[]}
 */
var findRestaurant = function(list1, list2) {
    const restaurants = {};
    let minSum = Infinity;
    const res = [];
    
    for(let i = 0; i < list1.length; i++){
        const listTwoIndex = list2.indexOf(list1[i])
        if(listTwoIndex !== -1){
            const indexSum = i + listTwoIndex
            restaurants[list1[i]] = indexSum
            minSum = Math.min(minSum, indexSum)
        }
    }
    
    for(const restaurant in restaurants){
        if(restaurants[restaurant] === minSum)
            res.push(restaurant)
    }
    
    return res
};

```

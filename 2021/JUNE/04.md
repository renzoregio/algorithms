#### [451. Sort Characters By Frequency](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-characters-by-frequency/)

Given a string s, sort it in decreasing order based on the frequency of characters, and return the sorted string.


```

Example 1:
Input: s = "tree"
Output: "eert"
Explanation: 'e' appears twice while 'r' and 't' both appear once.
So 'e' must appear before both 'r' and 't'. Therefore "eetr" is also a valid answer.

Example 2:
Input: s = "cccaaa"
Output: "aaaccc"
Explanation: Both 'c' and 'a' appear three times, so "aaaccc" is also a valid answer.
Note that "cacaca" is incorrect, as the same characters must be together.

Example 3:
Input: s = "Aabb"
Output: "bbAa"
Explanation: "bbaA" is also a valid answer, but "Aabb" is incorrect.
Note that 'A' and 'a' are treated as two different characters.

```

Constraints:

* 1 <= s.length <= 5 * 10<sup>5</sup>
* s consists of English letters and digits.

#### [1662. Check If Two String Arrays are Equivalent](https://leetcode.com/problems/check-if-two-string-arrays-are-equivalent/)

Given two string arrays word1 and word2, return true if the two arrays represent the same string, and false otherwise.

A string is represented by an array if the array elements concatenated in order forms the string.


```

Example 1:
Input: word1 = ["ab", "c"], word2 = ["a", "bc"]
Output: true
Explanation:
word1 represents string "ab" + "c" -> "abc"
word2 represents string "a" + "bc" -> "abc"
The strings are the same, so return true.

Example 2:
Input: word1 = ["a", "cb"], word2 = ["ab", "c"]
Output: false

Example 3:
Input: word1  = ["abc", "d", "defg"], word2 = ["abcddefg"]
Output: true

```

Constraints:

* 1 <= word1.length, word2.length <= 10<sup>3</sup>
* 1 <= word1[i].length, word2[i].length <= 10<sup>3</sup>
* 1 <= sum(word1[i].length), sum(word2[i].length) <= 10<sup>3</sup>
* word1[i] and word2[i] consist of lowercase letters.

### JavaScript

```js

/**
 * @param {string[]} word1
 * @param {string[]} word2
 * @return {boolean}
 */
var arrayStringsAreEqual = function(word1, word2) {
    return word1.join("") === word2.join("") ? true : false
};

```

### Python

```py

class Solution(object):
    def arrayStringsAreEqual(self, word1, word2):
        """
        :type word1: List[str]
        :type word2: List[str]
        :rtype: bool
        """
        return True if ''.join(word1) == ''.join(word2) else False
        
```

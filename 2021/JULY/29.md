### QUESTION

#### [191. Number of 1 Bits](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-1-bits/)

Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and returns the number of '1' bits it has (also known as the Hamming weight).

Note:

* Note that in some languages, such as Java, there is no unsigned integer type. In this case, the input will be given as a signed integer type. It should not affect your implementation, as the integer's internal binary representation is the same, whether it is signed or unsigned.
* In Java, the compiler represents the signed integers using 2's complement notation. Therefore, in Example 3, the input represents the signed integer. -3.

```
Example 1:
Input: n = 00000000000000000000000000001011
Output: 3
Explanation: The input binary string 00000000000000000000000000001011 has a total of three '1' bits.

Example 2:
Input: n = 00000000000000000000000010000000
Output: 1
Explanation: The input binary string 00000000000000000000000010000000 has a total of one '1' bit.

Example 3:
Input: n = 11111111111111111111111111111101
Output: 31
Explanation: The input binary string 11111111111111111111111111111101 has a total of thirty one '1' bits.
```

Constraints:

* The input must be a binary string of length 32.

### JavaScript

```js

/**
 * @param {number} n - a positive integer
 * @return {number}
 */
var hammingWeight = function(n) {
    let bits = decipher(n)
    let bitCount = 0
    for(let i = 0; i < bits.length; i++){
        if(bits[i] === "1"){
            bitCount++
        }
    }
    return bitCount
};


const decipher = (num) => {
    return (num >>> 0).toString(2)
}

```

### Python3

```py3

from collections import Counter

class Solution:
    def hammingWeight(self, n: int) -> int:
        bits = "{0:b}".format(n)
        counter = Counter(bits)
        return counter["1"]
        
```

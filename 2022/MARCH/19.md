#### [392. Is Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/is-subsequence/)

Given two strings s and t, return true if s is a subsequence of t, or false otherwise.

A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).


Example 1:

```
Input: s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: true
```

Example 2:

```
Input: s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: false
```

Constraints:

* 0 <= s.length <= 100
* 0 <= t.length <= 10<sup>4</sup>
* s and t consist only of lowercase English letters.

### JavaScript

```js

/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @param {string} t
 * @return {boolean}
 */
var isSubsequence = function(s, t) {
    let stack = s.split("");
    for(let i = t.length - 1; i > -1; i--){
        if(stack[stack.length - 1] === t[i]){
            stack.pop();
            if(stack.length === 0)
                return true;
        }
    }
    
    return stack.length === 0 ? true : false;
};

```

#### [153. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-minimum-in-rotated-sorted-array/)

Suppose an array of length n sorted in ascending order is rotated between 1 and n times. For example, the array nums = [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become:

* [4,5,6,7,0,1,2] if it was rotated 4 times.
* [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] if it was rotated 7 times.

Notice that rotating an array [a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]] 1 time results in the array [a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]].

Given the sorted rotated array nums of unique elements, return the minimum element of this array.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.


```

Example 1:
Input: nums = [3,4,5,1,2]
Output: 1
Explanation: The original array was [1,2,3,4,5] rotated 3 times.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]
Output: 0
Explanation: The original array was [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] and it was rotated 4 times.

Example 3:
Input: nums = [11,13,15,17]
Output: 11
Explanation: The original array was [11,13,15,17] and it was rotated 4 times. 

```

Constraints:

* n == nums.length
* 1 <= n <= 5000
* -5000 <= nums[i] <= 5000
* All the integers of nums are unique.
* nums is sorted and rotated between 1 and n times.

#### [383. Ransom Note](https://leetcode.com/problems/ransom-note/)

Given two stings ransomNote and magazine, return true if ransomNote can be constructed from magazine and false otherwise.

Each letter in magazine can only be used once in ransomNote.

```

Example 1:
Input: ransomNote = "a", magazine = "b"
Output: false

Example 2:
Input: ransomNote = "aa", magazine = "ab"
Output: false

Example 3:
Input: ransomNote = "aa", magazine = "aab"
Output: true

```

Constraints:

* 1 <= ransomNote.length, magazine.length <= 10<sup>5</sup>
* ransomNote and magazine consist of lowercase English letters.

### JavaScript

```js

/**
 * @param {string} ransomNote
 * @param {string} magazine
 * @return {boolean}
 */
var canConstruct = function(ransomNote, magazine) {
    let magazineArray = magazine.split("")
    let ransomArray = ransomNote.split("")
    let count = 0
    for(let i = 0; i < ransomArray.length; i++){
        for(let j = 0; j < magazineArray.length; j++){
            if(ransomArray[i] == magazineArray[j]){
                count += 1
                magazineArray.splice(j, 1)

#### [1704. Determine if String Halves Are Alike](https://leetcode.com/problems/determine-if-string-halves-are-alike/)

You are given a string s of even length. Split this string into two halves of equal lengths, and let a be the first half and b be the second half.

Two strings are alike if they have the same number of vowels ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u', 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U'). Notice that s contains uppercase and lowercase letters.

Return true if a and b are alike. Otherwise, return false.

```
Example 1:
Input: s = "book"
Output: true
Explanation: a = "bo" and b = "ok". a has 1 vowel and b has 1 vowel. Therefore, they are alike.

Example 2:
Input: s = "textbook"
Output: false
Explanation: a = "text" and b = "book". a has 1 vowel whereas b has 2. Therefore, they are not alike.
Notice that the vowel o is counted twice.

Example 3:
Input: s = "MerryChristmas"
Output: false

Example 4:
Input: s = "AbCdEfGh"
Output: true
```

Constraints:

* 2 <= s.length <= 1000
* s.length is even.
* s consists of uppercase and lowercase letters.

        vowel_count = 0
        for i in range(len(a)):
            if a[i] in vowels:
                vowel_count += 1
            if b[i] in vowels:
                vowel_count -= 1
        return True if vowel_count == 0. else False

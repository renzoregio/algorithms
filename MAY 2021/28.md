#### [151. Reverse Words in a String](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-words-in-a-string/)

Given an input string s, reverse the order of the words.

A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The words in s will be separated by at least one space.

Return a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space.

Note that s may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between two words. The returned string should only have a single space separating the words. Do not include any extra spaces.



```
Example 1:
Input: s = "the sky is blue"
Output: "blue is sky the"

Example 2:
Input: s = "  hello world  "
Output: "world hello"
Explanation: Your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.

Example 3:
Input: s = "a good   example"
Output: "example good a"
Explanation: You need to reduce multiple spaces between two words to a single space in the reversed string.

Example 4:
Input: s = "  Bob    Loves  Alice   "
Output: "Alice Loves Bob"

Example 5:
Input: s = "Alice does not even like bob"
Output: "bob like even not does Alice"

```

Constraints:

* 1 <= s.length <= 10<sup>4</sup>
* s contains English letters (upper-case and lower-case), digits, and spaces ' '.
* There is at least one word in s.

### JavaScript

```js

/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @return {string}
 */
var reverseWords = function(s) {
    const words = s.split(" ").reverse()
    const reversed_arr = words.filter(word => word !== "")
    const reversed = reversed_arr.join(" ")
    return reversed
};

```

### Python

```py

class Solution(object):
    def reverseWords(self, s):
        """
        :type s: str
        :rtype: str
        """
        words = s.split()
        words.reverse()
        return ' '.join(words)

#### [1796. Second Largest Digit in a String](https://leetcode.com/problems/second-largest-digit-in-a-string/)

Given an alphanumeric string s, return the second largest numerical digit that appears in s, or -1 if it does not exist.

An alphanumeric string is a string consisting of lowercase English letters and digits.

```

Example 1:
Input: s = "dfa12321afd"
Output: 2
Explanation: The digits that appear in s are [1, 2, 3]. The second largest digit is 2.

Example 2:
Input: s = "abc1111"
Output: -1
Explanation: The digits that appear in s are [1]. There is no second largest digit. 

```

Constraints:

* 1 <= s.length <= 500
* s consists of only lowercase English letters and/or digits.

### JavaScript

```js

/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @return {number}
 */
var secondHighest = function(s) {
    let characters = s.split("")
    let nums = characters.filter(char => !isNaN(char))
    let unique_nums = [...new Set(nums)]
    unique_nums.sort((a,b) => a - b)
    if(unique_nums.length <= 1){
        return -1
    } else {
        return unique_nums[unique_nums.indexOf(Math.max(...unique_nums).toString()) - 1]
    }
}

```

### Python

```py

class Solution(object):
    def secondHighest(self, s):
        """
        :type s: str
        :rtype: int
        """
        x = list(set(s))
        nums = [int(char) for char in x if char.isdigit() and int(char) >= 0]
        if len(nums) == 1 or len(nums) == 0:
            return -1
        else:
            nums.sort()
            return nums[nums.index(max(nums)) - 1]

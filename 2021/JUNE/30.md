#### [884. Uncommon Words from Two Sentences](https://leetcode.com/problems/uncommon-words-from-two-sentences/)

A sentence is a string of single-space separated words where each word consists only of lowercase letters.

A word is uncommon if it appears exactly once in one of the sentences, and does not appear in the other sentence.

Given two sentences s1 and s2, return a list of all the uncommon words. You may return the answer in any order.

```
Example 1:
Input: s1 = "this apple is sweet", s2 = "this apple is sour"
Output: ["sweet","sour"]

Example 2:
Input: s1 = "apple apple", s2 = "banana"
Output: ["banana"]
```

Constraints:

* 1 <= s1.length, s2.length <= 200
* s1 and s2 consist of lowercase English letters and spaces.
* s1 and s2 do not have leading or trailing spaces.
* All the words in s1 and s2 are separated by a single space.

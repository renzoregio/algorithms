#### [2095. Delete the Middle Node of a Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-the-middle-node-of-a-linked-list/)

You are given the head of a linked list. Delete the middle node, and return the head of the modified linked list.

The middle node of a linked list of size n is the ⌊n / 2⌋th node from the start using 0-based indexing, where ⌊x⌋ denotes the largest integer less than or equal to x.

* For n = 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, the middle nodes are 0, 1, 1, 2, and 2, respectively.


Example 1:

![Example 1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/11/16/eg1drawio.png)

```
Input: head = [1,3,4,7,1,2,6]
Output: [1,3,4,1,2,6]
Explanation:
The above figure represents the given linked list. The indices of the nodes are written below.
Since n = 7, node 3 with value 7 is the middle node, which is marked in red.
We return the new list after removing this node. 
```

Example 2:

![Example 2](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/11/16/eg2drawio.png)

```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [1,2,4]
Explanation:
The above figure represents the given linked list.
For n = 4, node 2 with value 3 is the middle node, which is marked in red.
```

Example 3:

![Example 3](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/11/16/eg3drawio.png)

```
Input: head = [2,1]
Output: [2]
Explanation:
The above figure represents the given linked list.
For n = 2, node 1 with value 1 is the middle node, which is marked in red.
Node 0 with value 2 is the only node remaining after removing node 1.
```

Constraints:

* The number of nodes in the list is in the range [1, 10<sup>5</sup>].
* 1 <= Node.val <= 10<sup>5</sup>

    let iterator = head;
    let count = 0;
    while(iterator){
        count++;
        iterator = iterator.next;
    }
    
    let m = Math.floor(count /2)
    iterator = head;
    let nodeBefore = null;
    while(m){
        if(m - 1 === 0){
            nodeBefore = iterator
        }
        iterator = iterator.next;
        m--;
    }
    
    
    nodeBefore.next = iterator.next
    return head
};

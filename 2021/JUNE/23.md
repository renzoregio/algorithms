#### [1859. Sorting the Sentence](https://leetcode.com/problems/sorting-the-sentence/)

A sentence is a list of words that are separated by a single space with no leading or trailing spaces. Each word consists of lowercase and uppercase English letters.

A sentence can be shuffled by appending the 1-indexed word position to each word then rearranging the words in the sentence.

* For example, the sentence "This is a sentence" can be shuffled as "sentence4 a3 is2 This1" or "is2 sentence4 This1 a3".

Given a shuffled sentence s containing no more than 9 words, reconstruct and return the original sentence.



```
Example 1:
Input: s = "is2 sentence4 This1 a3"
Output: "This is a sentence"
Explanation: Sort the words in s to their original positions "This1 is2 a3 sentence4", then remove the numbers.

Example 2:
Input: s = "Myself2 Me1 I4 and3"
Output: "Me Myself and I"
Explanation: Sort the words in s to their original positions "Me1 Myself2 and3 I4", then remove the numbers.
```

Constraints:

* 2 <= s.length <= 200
* s consists of lowercase and uppercase English letters, spaces, and digits from 1 to 9.
* The number of words in s is between 1 and 9.
* The words in s are separated by a single space.
* s contains no leading or trailing spaces.

### JavaScript

```js

/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @return {string}
 */
var sortSentence = function(s) {
    let words = s.split(" ")
    let reversed = []
    for(let i = 0; i < words.length; i++){
         let word = words[i].split("")
         word.reverse()
        reversed.push(word.join(""))
    }
    reversed.sort()
    let sentence = ""
    for(let j = 0; j < reversed.length; j++){
        let word = reversed[j].split("")
        word.shift()
        word.reverse()
        sentence += word.join("")
        sentence += " "
    }
    return sentence.slice(0, -1)
};
```

    def sortSentence(self, s: str) -> str:
        words = s.split()
        reversed_words = []
        for word in words:
            i = list(word)
            i.reverse()
            reversed_words.append(''.join(i))
        reversed_words.sort()
        sentence = ""
        for word in reversed_words:
            j = list(word)
            j.pop(0)
            j.reverse()
            sentence += ''.join(j)
            sentence += " "
        return sentence[0:-1]

#### [1351. Count Negative Numbers in a Sorted Matrix](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-negative-numbers-in-a-sorted-matrix/)

Given a m x n matrix grid which is sorted in non-increasing order both row-wise and column-wise, return the number of negative numbers in grid.

```
Example 1:
Input: grid = [[4,3,2,-1],[3,2,1,-1],[1,1,-1,-2],[-1,-1,-2,-3]]
Output: 8
Explanation: There are 8 negatives number in the matrix.

Example 2:
Input: grid = [[3,2],[1,0]]
Output: 0

Example 3:
Input: grid = [[1,-1],[-1,-1]]
Output: 3

Example 4:
Input: grid = [[-1]]
Output: 1
```

Constraints:

* m == grid.length
* n == grid[ i ].length
* 1 <= m, n <= 100
* -100 <= grid[ i ][ j ] <= 100

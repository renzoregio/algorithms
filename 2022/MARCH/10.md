#### [1143. Longest Common Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-common-subsequence/)

Given two strings text1 and text2, return the length of their longest common subsequence. If there is no common subsequence, return 0.

A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

* For example, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde".

A common subsequence of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings.

Example 1:

```
Input: text1 = "abcde", text2 = "ace" 
Output: 3  
Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "ace" and its length is 3.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "abc"
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "abc" and its length is 3.
```

Example 3:

```
Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "def"
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no such common subsequence, so the result is 0.
```

Constraints:

* 1 <= text1.length, text2.length <= 1000
* text1 and text2 consist of only lowercase English characters.

### JavaScript

```js

/**
 * @param {string} text1
 * @param {string} text2
 * @return {number}
 */
var longestCommonSubsequence = function(text1, text2) {
    const arr = [];
    for(let i = 0; i <= text2.length; i++){
        let newArr = [];
        for(let j = 0; j <= text1.length; j++){
            newArr.push(0);
        }
        arr.push(newArr);
    }
    
    for(let i = text2.length - 1; i > -1 ; i--){
        for(let j = text1.length - 1; j > -1; j--){
            if(text2[i] === text1[j])
                arr[i][j] = 1 + arr[i + 1][j + 1]
            else 
                 arr[i][j] = Math.max(arr[i][j + 1], arr[i + 1][j])  
        }
    }
    
    return arr[0][0]
};

```

#### [1935. Maximum Number of Words You Can Type](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-words-you-can-type/submissions/)

There is a malfunctioning keyboard where some letter keys do not work. All other keys on the keyboard work properly.

Given a string text of words separated by a single space (no leading or trailing spaces) and a string brokenLetters of all distinct letter keys that are broken, return the number of words in text you can fully type using this keyboard.

```
Example 1:
Input: text = "hello world", brokenLetters = "ad"
Output: 1
Explanation: We cannot type "world" because the 'd' key is broken.

Example 2:
Input: text = "leet code", brokenLetters = "lt"
Output: 1
Explanation: We cannot type "leet" because the 'l' and 't' keys are broken.

Example 3:
Input: text = "leet code", brokenLetters = "e"
Output: 0
Explanation: We cannot type either word because the 'e' key is broken.
```

Constraints:

* 1 <= text.length <= 10<sup>4</sup>
* 0 <= brokenLetters.length <= 26
* text consists of words separated by a single space without any leading or trailing spaces.
* Each word only consists of lowercase English letters.
* brokenLetters consists of distinct lowercase English letters.

### JavaScript

```js

/**
 * @param {string} text
 * @param {string} brokenLetters
 * @return {number}
 */
var canBeTypedWords = function(text, brokenLetters) {
    let words = text.split(" ")
    let total = words.length
    words.forEach(word => {
        for(let i = 0; i < brokenLetters.length; i++){
            if(word.includes(brokenLetters[i])){
                total -= 1
                break
            }
        }
    })
    return total
};

```

### Python

```py

class Solution(object):
    def canBeTypedWords(self, text, brokenLetters):
        """
        :type text: str
        :type brokenLetters: str
        :rtype: int
        """
        words = text.split()
        total = len(words)
        for word in words:
            for letter in brokenLetters:
                if letter in word:
                    total -= 1
                    break
        return total
        
```

#### [925. Long Pressed Name](https://leetcode.com/problems/long-pressed-name/)

Your friend is typing his name into a keyboard. Sometimes, when typing a character c, the key might get long pressed, and the character will be typed 1 or more times.

You examine the typed characters of the keyboard. Return True if it is possible that it was your friends name, with some characters (possibly none) being long pressed.

```
Example 1:
Input: name = "alex", typed = "aaleex"
Output: true
Explanation: 'a' and 'e' in 'alex' were long pressed.

Example 2:
Input: name = "saeed", typed = "ssaaedd"
Output: false
Explanation: 'e' must have been pressed twice, but it wasn't in the typed output.

Example 3:
Input: name = "leelee", typed = "lleeelee"
Output: true

Example 4:
Input: name = "laiden", typed = "laiden"
Output: true
Explanation: It's not necessary to long press any character.
```

Constraints:

* 1 <= name.length <= 1000
* 1 <= typed.length <= 1000
* name and typed contain only lowercase English letters.

#### [1624. Largest Substring Between Two Equal Characters](https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-substring-between-two-equal-characters/)

Given a string s, return the length of the longest substring between two equal characters, excluding the two characters. If there is no such substring return -1.

A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.



```
Example 1:
Input: s = "aa"
Output: 0
Explanation: The optimal substring here is an empty substring between the two 'a's.

Example 2:
Input: s = "abca"
Output: 2
Explanation: The optimal substring here is "bc".

Example 3:
Input: s = "cbzxy"
Output: -1
Explanation: There are no characters that appear twice in s.

Example 4:
Input: s = "cabbac"
Output: 4
Explanation: The optimal substring here is "abba". Other non-optimal substrings include "bb" and "".
```

Constraints:

* 1 <= s.length <= 300
* s contains only lowercase English letters.

### JavaScript

```js
/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @return {number}
 */
var maxLengthBetweenEqualCharacters = function(s) {
    let arr = s.split("")
    let longestLength = 0
    let match = false
    for(let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++){
        let arrCopy = arr.slice(i + 1)
        if(arrCopy.includes(arr[i])){
            let counter = arrCopy.length - 1
            while(arr[i] !== arrCopy[counter]){
                  counter -= 1
            }
            let currentLength = arr.slice(i, counter + i).length
            if(currentLength > longestLength){
                longestLength = currentLength
            }
            match = true
        }
    }
    return match ? longestLength : -1
};
```

#### [1109. Corporate Flight Bookings](https://leetcode.com/problems/corporate-flight-bookings/)

There are n flights that are labeled from 1 to n.

You are given an array of flight bookings bookings, where bookings[ i ] = [first<sub>i</sub>, last<sub>i</sub>, seats<sub>i</sub>] represents a booking for flights first<sub>i</sub> through last<sub>i</sub> (inclusive) with seats<sub>i</sub> seats reserved for each flight in the range.

Return an array answer of length n, where answer[ i ] is the total number of seats reserved for flight i.

Example 1:

```
Input: bookings = [[1,2,10],[2,3,20],[2,5,25]], n = 5
Output: [10,55,45,25,25]
Explanation:
Flight labels:        1   2   3   4   5
Booking 1 reserved:  10  10
Booking 2 reserved:      20  20
Booking 3 reserved:      25  25  25  25
Total seats:         10  55  45  25  25
Hence, answer = [10,55,45,25,25]
```

Example 2:

```
Input: bookings = [[1,2,10],[2,2,15]], n = 2
Output: [10,25]
Explanation:
Flight labels:        1   2
Booking 1 reserved:  10  10
Booking 2 reserved:      15
Total seats:         10  25
Hence, answer = [10,25]
```

Constraints:

* 1 <= n <= 2 * 10<sup>4</sup>
* 1 <= bookings.length <= 2 * 10<sup>4</sup>
* bookings[ i ].length == 3
* 1 <= first<sub>i</sub> <= last<sub>i</sub> <= n
* 1 <= seats<sub>i</sub> <= 10<sup>4</sup>

### JavaScript

```js

/**
 * @param {number[][]} bookings
 * @param {number} n
 * @return {number[]}
 */
var corpFlightBookings = function(bookings, n) {
    const res = []
    for(let i = 0; i < n; i++)
        res[i] = 0
    
    for(let i = 0; i < bookings.length; i++){
        let start = bookings[i][0] - 1
        let end = bookings[i][1]
        let seats = bookings[i][2]
        for(let j = start; j < end; j++){
            res[j] += seats
        }
    }
    
    return res
};

```

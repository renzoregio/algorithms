#### [1967. Number of Strings That Appear as Substrings in Word](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-strings-that-appear-as-substrings-in-word/)

Given an array of strings patterns and a string word, return the number of strings in patterns that exist as a substring in word.

A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.

```
Example 1:
Input: patterns = ["a","abc","bc","d"], word = "abc"
Output: 3
Explanation:
- "a" appears as a substring in "abc".
- "abc" appears as a substring in "abc".
- "bc" appears as a substring in "abc".
- "d" does not appear as a substring in "abc".
3 of the strings in patterns appear as a substring in word.

Example 2:
Input: patterns = ["a","b","c"], word = "aaaaabbbbb"
Output: 2
Explanation:
- "a" appears as a substring in "aaaaabbbbb".
- "b" appears as a substring in "aaaaabbbbb".
- "c" does not appear as a substring in "aaaaabbbbb".
2 of the strings in patterns appear as a substring in word.

Example 3:
Input: patterns = ["a","a","a"], word = "ab"
Output: 3
Explanation: Each of the patterns appears as a substring in word "ab".
```

Constraints:

* 1 <= patterns.length <= 100
* 1 <= patterns[ i ].length <= 100
* 1 <= word.length <= 100
* patterns[ i ] and word consist of lowercase English letters

### JavaScript

```js
/**
 * @param {string[]} patterns
 * @param {string} word
 * @return {number}
 */
var numOfStrings = function(patterns, word) {
    let count = 0;
    patterns.forEach(chars => {
        if(word.includes(chars)){
            count++
        }
    })
    return count;
};
```

-----

### Python

```py
class Solution(object):
    def numOfStrings(self, patterns, word):
        """
        :type patterns: List[str]
        :type word: str
        :rtype: int
        """
        count = 0
        for chars in patterns:
            if chars in word:
                count += 1
        return count       
```

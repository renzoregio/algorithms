#### [1773. Count Items Matching a Rule](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-items-matching-a-rule/)

You are given an array items, where each items[ i ] = [type<sub>i</sub>, color<sub>i</sub>, name<sub>i</sub>] describes the type, color, and name of the i<sup>th</sup> item. You are also given a rule represented by two strings, ruleKey and ruleValue.

The i<sup>th</sup> item is said to match the rule if one of the following is true:

* ruleKey == "type" and ruleValue == type<sub>i</sub>.
* ruleKey == "color" and ruleValue == color<sub>i</sub>.
* ruleKey == "name" and ruleValue == name<sub>i</sub>.

Return the number of items that match the given rule.


```
Example 1:
Input: items = [["phone","blue","pixel"],["computer","silver","lenovo"],["phone","gold","iphone"]], ruleKey = "color", ruleValue = "silver"
Output: 1
Explanation: There is only one item matching the given rule, which is ["computer","silver","lenovo"].

Example 2:
Input: items = [["phone","blue","pixel"],["computer","silver","phone"],["phone","gold","iphone"]], ruleKey = "type", ruleValue = "phone"
Output: 2
Explanation: There are only two items matching the given rule, which are ["phone","blue","pixel"] and ["phone","gold","iphone"]. Note that the item ["computer","silver","phone"] does not match.
```

Constraints:

* 1 <= items.length <= 10<sup>4</sup>
* 1 <= type<sub>i</sub>.length, color<sub>i</sub>.length, name<sub>i</sub>.length, ruleValue.length <= 10
* ruleKey is equal to either "type", "color", or "name".
* All strings consist only of lowercase letters.

### JavaScript

```js
/**
 * @param {string[][]} items
 * @param {string} ruleKey
 * @param {string} ruleValue
 * @return {number}
 */
var countMatches = function(items, ruleKey, ruleValue) {
    let count = 0;
    const values = ["type", "color", "name"];
    const index = values.indexOf(ruleKey);
    items.forEach(arr => {
        if(arr[index] === ruleValue){
            count++
        }
    })
    return count;
};
```

### Python

```py
class Solution(object):
    def countMatches(self, items, ruleKey, ruleValue):
        """
        :type items: List[List[str]]
        :type ruleKey: str
        :type ruleValue: str
        :rtype: int
        """
        values = ["type", "color", "name"]
        index = values.index(ruleKey)
        count = 0
        for arr in items:
            if arr[index] == ruleValue:
                count += 1
        return count   
```

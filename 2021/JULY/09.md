### QUESTION

#### [70. Climbing Stairs](https://leetcode.com/problems/climbing-stairs/)

You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top.

Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?


```
Example 1:
Input: n = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step
2. 2 steps

Example 2:
Input: n = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
2. 1 step + 2 steps
3. 2 steps + 1 step
```

Constraints:

* 1 <= n <= 45

### JavaScript

```js

/**
 * @param {number} n
 * @return {number}
 */
var climbStairs = function(n) {
    const steps = solveForSteps(1, 1, n)
    return steps
};


const solveForSteps = (first, second, maxStep) => {
    if(maxStep === 1){
        return first
    }
    let steps = first + second
    second = first
    first = steps
    maxStep -= 1
    return solveForSteps(first, second, maxStep)
}
```

### Python

```py

class Solution(object):
    def climbStairs(self, n):
        """
        :type n: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        steps = self.solve(1, 1, n)
        return steps
    
    def solve(self, first, second, max_val):
        if max_val == 1:
            return first
        steps = first + second
        second = first
        first = steps
        max_val -= 1
        return self.solve(first, second, max_val)
        
```

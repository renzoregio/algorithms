#### [441. Arranging Coins](https://leetcode.com/problems/arranging-coins/)

You have n coins and you want to build a staircase with these coins. The staircase consists of k rows where the i<sup>th</sup> row has exactly i coins. The last row of the staircase may be incomplete.

Given the integer n, return the number of complete rows of the staircase you will build.

Example 1:

![Example 1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/04/09/arrangecoins1-grid.jpg)

```
Input: n = 5
Output: 2
Explanation: Because the 3rd row is incomplete, we return 2.
```

Example 2:

![Example 2](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/04/09/arrangecoins2-grid.jpg)

```
Input: n = 8
Output: 3
Explanation: Because the 4th row is incomplete, we return 3.
```

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 2<sup>31</sup> - 1

### JavaScript

```js

/**
 * @param {number} n
 * @return {number}
 */
var arrangeCoins = function(n) {
    let row = 0;
    let completeRows = 0
    while(n){
        row++;
        n -= row;
        if(n >= 0)
            completeRows++
        else
            break
    }
    
    return completeRows
};

```

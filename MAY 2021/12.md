#### [344. Reverse String](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-string/)

Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters s.

``` 

Example 1:
Input: s = ["h","e","l","l","o"]
Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]

Example 2:
Input: s = ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]

```

Constraints:

* 1 <= s.length <= 105
* s[i] is a printable ascii character.

Follow up: Do not allocate extra space for another array. You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

-----

### Solution: JavaScript

```

/**
 * @param {character[]} s
 * @return {void} Do not return anything, modify s in-place instead.
 */
var reverseString = function(s) {
    s.reverse()
};

```

-----

### Solution: Python

```

class Solution(object):
    def reverseString(self, s):
        """
        :type s: List[str]
        :rtype: None Do not return anything, modify s in-place instead.
        """
        s.reverse()
        
```
